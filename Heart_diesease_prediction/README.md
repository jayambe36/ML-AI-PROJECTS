# Heart Diesease Prediction
A model to predict heart disease with a GUI.

The proposed model presented in this study aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease by leveraging three distinct classification algorithms: 1. k Neighbors Classification, 2. Logistic Regression, and 3. Random Forest Classifier. Comprehensive performance analysis is conducted using a range of evaluation metrics, including Randomized Search CV, Grid Search CV, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, Precision Score, Recall Score, F1 Score, and Accuracy Score. The primary objective of this predictive model is to determine whether a patient is at risk of heart disease. To achieve this, healthcare professionals input relevant values from the patient's health report into the model, which then calculates the probability of the patient having heart disease based on the chosen algorithms and evaluation metrics.
